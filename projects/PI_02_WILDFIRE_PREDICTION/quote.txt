Desc: "Wildfire Prediction was a iaac research project utilizing machine learning algorithms and environmental data analysis to forecast wildfire occurrence, spread patterns, and risk zones at regional and continental scales. The project integrated satellite imagery, weather data, vegetation indices, and historical fire patterns to train predictive models that identify high-risk areas before ignition occurs. By providing early warning systems and resource allocation guidance, the research aims to support emergency preparedness and land management decisions. The project demonstrates how computational intelligence can be applied to planetary-scale environmental challenges, potentially saving lives and protecting ecosystems.
