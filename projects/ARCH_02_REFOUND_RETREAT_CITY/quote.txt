Desc: "Refound Retreat Center was an architectural design project that envisioned a sustainable forest-integrated retreat destination emphasizing wellness, community connection, and environmental harmony. The master-planned development features biomorphic pod structures nestled within dense forest canopy, each housing dedicated retreat programs ranging from meditation to cultural activities. The design integrates nature-centric architecture with experiential spaces, utilizing parametrically-designed dome and cone structures that minimize environmental impact while maximizing inhabitant experience. The project demonstrates a holistic approach to eco-tourism and wellness architecture, creating a transformative landscape where built form and natural environment coexist in symbiotic relationship."
