Desc: "Guided Generative Design Workspace was a project developed to automate and optimize architectural floor plan generation through parametric design principles and intelligent constraint-based algorithms. The system accepts programmatic briefs and spatial requirements, then generates multiple design iterations that comply with building codes, occupancy standards, and design metrics. By leveraging generative design workflows, the project enables architects to rapidly explore design alternatives while maintaining control over key performance indicators such as space efficiency, circulation patterns, and occupancy metrics. The workspace serves as a bridge between user intent and computational design, allowing for interactive refinement of generated solutions."
