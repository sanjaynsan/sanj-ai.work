Jakarta’s rapid urbanization has outpaced the development of equitable mobility infrastructure, exacerbating safety disparities, particularly for low-income women navigating the city at night. While formal policies fall short, informal transport networks like Angkot fill critical gaps, despite exposing riders to physical and psychological risks. This study explores how machine learning can be used to fill the spatial-temporal data gap causing safety injustice in Jakarta by unpacking qualities of the alternative transport networks, in order to build a tool that aligns public policies with community needs through an intersectional lens in Jakarta

Jakarta’s explosive growth has outstripped its mobility infrastructure, leaving vulnerable communities—especially low-income women—facing unsafe, inefficient journeys after sundown. Traditional data sources and formal policies rarely capture the lived realities of informal transport networks like Angkot, who bridge critical gaps but often at great personal risk to riders.

The Safety Route Finder uses machine-learning–driven computer vision and natural-language preferences to close this spatial-temporal data divide. By unpacking the real-world qualities of alternative transport corridors and transforming them into actionable maps, indicators, and scores, the tool empowers NGOs and government agencies to align public policy with community needs through an intersectional lens.
