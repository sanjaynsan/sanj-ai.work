Desc:"This project explores 3D printing as a rapid-prototyping tool for architectural design. The fabrication process was driven by personal interest in manifesting diverse and complex spatial forms that challenge traditional building methods. The images display various experimental models printed and fabricated to investigate these novel architectural spaces. This approach utilizes digital fabrication to explore unique geometries and material applications that allow for high levels of customization."
