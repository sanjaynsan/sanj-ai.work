Desc: "This Lexus Car Showroom project is a self-directed fabrication research into parametric spaces, utilizing glass and light as primary materials for experimentation. The innovative design uses a system of vertical fins to create dynamic visual patterns and unique spatial experiences within the showroom environment, exploring how a diagrid pattern can define different pockets of space. The project successfully bridges digital design and physical model-making, resulting in an immersive, luxury space that showcases the brand's vehicles."
