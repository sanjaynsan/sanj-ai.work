Desc: "Can wildfire risk be anticipated before it becomes an emergency?
This research project develops a multi-scale computational framework to forecast wildfire occurrence, spread, and risk zones using machine learning and planetary-scale geospatial data. Initiated during a six-month research studio with Forensic Architecture, the project was motivated by recent wildfire events—most notably in Los Angeles—where risk was known in advance by institutional actors but not communicated to communities.

The project combines environmental indices, spatial infrastructure data, and object detection models to support emergency preparedness and land-management decision-making. Operating across macro, meso, and micro scales, the system translates complex environmental intelligence into actionable insights for citizens, planners, and local authorities. The research culminates in a public-facing web application built on Google Earth Engine, enabling open access to wildfire risk awareness."

img02: "A temporal data visualization highlights the rising number of wildfire-related fatalities over time, indicating an accelerating global risk trend."

img03: "A narrative comic translates wildfire intelligence for different stakeholders, including insurance actors, local residents, community leaders, and urban planners, emphasizing varied preparedness needs."

img04: "The project framework is structured across three spatial scales—macro, meso, and micro—defining how data, analysis, and decision support adapt to different levels of intervention."

img05: "At the macro scale, NDVI and NDMI indices are correlated to identify global vegetation and moisture patterns associated with wildfire-prone regions, validated across multiple cities."

img06: "At the meso scale, global environmental data is combined with local infrastructure datasets such as fire stations, hospitals, and water access points to generate regional wildfire vulnerability maps."

img07: "At the micro scale, satellite imagery and machine learning models trained in Roboflow detect community-level resources—such as swimming pools—that can act as emergency fire-response assets."

img08: "The project concludes by demonstrating how multi-scale environmental intelligence can support community preparedness, equitable risk communication, and informed land-use decisions through an open, accessible digital platform."
