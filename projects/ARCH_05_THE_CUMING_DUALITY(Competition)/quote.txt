Desc: "The Cuming Duality was a competition design project exploring the relationship between contrasting urban conditions and the creation of dynamic public spaces that bridge different contexts. The design investigates the interplay between solid and void, permanence and ephemera, and cultural identity and global influence. Through carefully orchestrated spatial sequences and material contrasts, the project creates environments that celebrate dualities while fostering unity and unexpected connections. The architecture demonstrates how thoughtful design can transform challenging site conditions into opportunities for innovative place-making."
