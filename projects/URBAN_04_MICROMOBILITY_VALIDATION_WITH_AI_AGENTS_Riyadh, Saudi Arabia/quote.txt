Desc: "How can proposed mobility interventions be evaluated before they are built?
This project introduces an AI-driven simulation framework to validate micro-mobility and superblock-inspired proposals at the neighborhood scale. Developed during an academic workshop with Bureau Happold, the study adapts the Barcelona superblock concept to the urban structure of Riyadh, where blocks are significantly larger and mobility is overwhelmingly car-oriented.

A selected Riyadh neighborhood was analyzed to understand modal share imbalance and access gaps in public transportation. The findings revealed limited walkable coverage from metro and bus stations, leaving large areas underserved. In response, the project proposes a network of shaded, walkable green corridors integrated with autonomous and low-speed mobility systems. To assess feasibility and social acceptance, an AI-agent–based simulation tool was developed, enabling participatory validation through diverse, behavior-driven mobility personas.

img04: "Walking-distance buffers of 5, 7, and 10 minutes from transit nodes demonstrate extensive areas beyond reasonable pedestrian reach, reinforcing the need for alternative micro-mobility solutions."

img05: "A proposed car-free green corridor network introduces shaded walkways, autonomous vehicles, and continuous pedestrian links, strategically looped to reconnect underserved zones."

img06: "An AI-agent simulation tool evaluates mobility choices between origin and destination points. Users can modify inputs and observe how different personas—defined by age, gender, and daily responsibilities—select among transport modes such as walking, car, taxi, autonomous vehicles, or the proposed green corridors. The system does not aim for predictive certainty but instead enables scenario testing and comparative behavioral insight."
