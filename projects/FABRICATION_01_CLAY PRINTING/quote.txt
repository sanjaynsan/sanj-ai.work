Desc: "This project, part of the "MORE THAN HUMANS" studio, explored advanced clay additive manufacturing. It used parametric design algorithms to create complex, 3D-printed ceramic homes for barn swallows. The sustainable, collaborative, and participatory design process involved working with local people near Santa Coloma, Barcelona. The research successfully combined digital fabrication precision with the tactile warmth of traditional clay craft. This approach demonstrated how robotic printing could enable mass customization while maintaining artisanal qualities".
