Desc: "(Not everything matters can be measured) 

In a world obsessed with quantifiable metrics, this project explores the boundaries of what cannot be easily measured. Focused on the vibrant neighborhood of Gràcia in Barcelona, the study employs multimodal AI—leveraging vision-based reasoning and large language models (LLMs)—to predict, interpret, and categorize urban soundscapes.

Rather than using traditional acoustic sensors, the approach synthesizes visual cues and spatial context to simulate what a place sounds like. These AI-predicted sounds are then dissected into “good” and “bad” categories, not by decibel count but by experiential quality—challenging the objectivity of noise pollution standards. The project raises critical questions about subjectivity in urban design: Can serenity be modeled? Can discomfort be detected through visuals alone? And most importantly, should all that’s loud be silenced?
We also explored those sounds and made them into tangible manifestation to bring the identity to the place again from the past
