Project Overview

ReCITYing is a European research and design initiative exploring how underused urban and rural landscapes can be reactivated through art, architecture, and data-driven methodologies. The Barcelona pilot focused on the Parc Agrari del Baix Llobregat—an active agricultural landscape under constant pressure from urban expansion.

As part of the Barcelona lands art research team, I developed a method to monitor agricultural fields temporally using satellite data, enabling a spatial and seasonal understanding of crop dynamics across the site.

Research Focus

My work addressed a core challenge in landscape-scale projects:
how to make long-term agricultural processes visible, measurable, and comparable across time.

Using multi-temporal satellite imagery, I analyzed:

seasonal crop growth patterns

vegetation health and variability

differences between crop types and management cycles

This allowed the team to move beyond static site analysis and engage with the land as a living, changing system.

Methodology

Multi-temporal satellite data analysis (NDVI and derived indicators)

Crop-specific temporal profiling

Spatial aggregation at field and parcel scale

Visualization of seasonal trends through radial and time-series representations

The outputs translated complex remote-sensing data into intuitive visual formats that could be used by designers, artists, and researchers working on the project.

Outcome & Impact

The developed methodology supported:

data-informed land art and spatial interventions

seasonal narratives of agricultural production

improved dialogue between scientific analysis and design exploration

By embedding satellite-based crop monitoring into a creative research context, the work demonstrated how environmental data can inform cultural and spatial practices, especially in productive landscapes at the urban edge.
