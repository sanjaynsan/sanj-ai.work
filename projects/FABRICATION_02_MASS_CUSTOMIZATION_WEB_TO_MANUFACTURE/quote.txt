WEB TO MANUFACTURE TECHNOLOGY
Custom Space is an online platform that allows users around the world to create their own personalized objects & spaces by connecting users to designers worldwide with locally accessible makers. At Custom Space we hope to foster local jobs and businesses that were previously shut out due to the economies of scale that the big brands monopolize
Custom Space has been able to do this by creating a 'web to manufacturer' technology that links data generated by parametric design tools online to the manufacturing processes of a decentralized network of makers and machines. The project was built under shape diver cloud based computation tool where I was part of the multidisciplinary team for creating the configurator and automating the fabrication drawings to millimeter precision for custom space decentralized network of manufacturers globally. The project led to the exploitation of web app development, API and cloud computing. The project also led to an exploration of generalizing the workflow for the designer and scripters around the world."
