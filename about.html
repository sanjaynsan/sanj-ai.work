      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>An enthusiast at the intersection of design and intelligence, I recently graduated with a
Master’s in City & Technology from IAAC Barcelona, where I was honored with the “Advanced
Urban Computation Excellence” award for the batch and served on the IAAC research team.
With a Bachelor’s in Architecture and over 4+ years of experience in computational design
and AI, I develop advanced computational design technologies for complex urban systems
and the built environment. My passion lies in transforming raw data into design intelligence
by generating, extracting, collecting, and articulating insights that drive innovative,
multidisciplinary solutions and multitech stacked automation workflows.
