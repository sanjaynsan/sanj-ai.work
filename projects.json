By integrating high-resolution remote sensing data with socio-environmental parameters, the index captures spatial variations in land surface temperature, vegetation cover, and built-up density. These physical indicators are then cross-referenced with demographic and infrastructural data, including population vulnerability (age, income levels, health conditions), access to shaded or green spaces, and availability of cooling infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThe resulting multi-criteria index enables a nuanced understanding of urban heat exposure and its differential impacts, allowing policymakers and urban planners to allocate resources more effectively. Priority zones are mapped to guide targeted interventions such as tree planting, reflective surface implementation, and the establishment of public cooling shelters. This data-driven approach not only enhances adaptive capacity in rapidly urbanizing regions but also supports equitable climate resilience strategies that center marginalized communities. The study underscores the critical role of geospatial analytics in crafting informed, just, and responsive heat mitigation policies in the face of escalating climate risks.\n\n\n\nMore information:https://blog.iaac.net/heat-archipelagos/\"",

Using Bengaluru\u2014often labeled the Silicon Valley of India\u2014as a case study, the project contrasts its global technological prominence with its mobility reality, where congestion and travel inefficiency dominate daily life.\n\n\n\nBuilding on Carlos Moreno\u2019s 15-minute city framework, the study analyzes whether daily urban needs can realistically be met within a 15-minute walking radius. Computational workflows using Grasshopper and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data were employed to measure amenity accessibility, spatial distribution, and population coverage. The result is a city-wide index that visualizes uneven access, revealing structural disparities between density, infrastructure, and everyday urban life.\"",
